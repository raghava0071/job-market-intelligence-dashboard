Amazon has a culture of data-driven decision-making and demands business intelligence that is timely, accurate, and actionable. We are looking for a talented and experienced Sr. Business Analyst to join the People Analytics team for Entertainment People eXperience and Technology (PXT) organization.

About The Role

As a Sr. Business Analyst, you will play a key role in driving data-informed decision-making across the Entertainment organization and beyond. You will understand the business and synthesize complex data from a variety of domains to create insights that have significant business impact. You’ll collaborate with cross-functional teams—including HR, project/program leads, data engineers, and senior business leaders—acting as both a builder and influencer.

In this role, you’ll design and scale analytical tools, dashboards, and reporting solutions using large and complex data lake/warehouse environments. You’ll build proof-of-concept reporting tools and evolve ad-hoc data artifacts into scalable, self-service solutions. Your work will enable teams across Entertainment to make fast, informed people decisions in a dynamic, often ambiguous environment.

You are expected to become deeply familiar with the business strategy and contribute directly to shaping it through your insights. You proactively monitor people performance metrics, assess risks, and identify opportunities—driving both tactical execution and long-term strategy. You know how to collect input across teams and independently define the analytical approach to solve business-critical problems. When faced with obstacles, you take initiative to unblock progress, keeping stakeholders informed throughout.

You seamlessly flex among various technical tools and platforms, choosing the right level of effort for the business value. You bring deep contextual knowledge and apply analytics best practices in all you do, focusing on high data quality, scalability, and continuous improvement. You are a strong verbal and written communicator, tailoring your messaging to diverse audiences—from technical peers to executive leaders—using effective storytelling to present data and influence outcomes. You own the communication of key metrics and their associated insights, often setting the standard for analytics communication across the organization.

This role requires someone with a passion for innovation, strong analytical and communication skills, and the ability to navigate complexity. You’ll thrive in this position if you’re curious, decisive, and excited to drive measurable impact in a high-stakes environment.
